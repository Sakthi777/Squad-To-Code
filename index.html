   <h3>Mechine Learning</h3> 
   <img src="image/ML.jpg" alt="Mechine Learning">
   <p> <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120">Mechine-Learning</a> algorithms use statistics to find patterns in massive* amounts of data. And data, here, encompasses a lot of things—numbers, words, images, clicks, what have you. If it can be digitally stored, it can be fed into a machine-learning algorithm. </p><br>
   <p> Machine learning is the process that powers many of the services we use today—recommendation systems like those on Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify; search engines like Google and Baidu; social-media feeds like Facebook and Twitter; voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. The list goes on.</p><br>
   <p> In all of these instances, each platform is collecting as much data about you as possible—what genres you like watching, what links you are clicking, which statuses you are reacting to—and using machine learning to make a highly educated guess about what you might want next. Or, in the case of a voice assistant, about which words match best with the funny sounds coming out of your mouth. </p><br>
</div>

<div id="five" class="data">
    <h3>Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</h3> 
    <img src="image/RPA.jpg" alt="Robotic Process Automation (RPA)">
    <p> <a href=https://www.upgrad.com/blog/what-is-robot-process-automation-rpa/>Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</a> is a technology used for automating daily tasks, similar to artificial intelligence. Here, the software is used for automating repetitive tasks such as handling and replying to emails, processing transactions, and handling business data. </p> <br>
    <p>This technology is used for automating tasks for low-level employees to higher-ranking officials. RPA can automate more than 40% of daily tasks. According to McKinsey, more than 60% of all repetitive tasks can be partially automated using RPA. So, this technology is going to threaten a lot of jobs. </p><br>
    <p>The different RPA job roles are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>RPA Developer</li>
